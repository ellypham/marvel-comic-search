# Marvel Comic Reads

This project is a comic reading list app. You'll be able to search by Marvel character names to display all the comics the character has appeared in and track them in a comic reading list.

## Getting Started

Search for your favourite Marvel character in the search bar. Once search is completed, Marvel character will be loaded with information and comics will be displayed and you'll be able to scroll through the list of comics to add to your comic read list. The comic read list will display the list of comics you have added to the list and you'll have the ability to to mark the comic off as read or delete.
